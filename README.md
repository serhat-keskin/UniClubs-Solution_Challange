**Welcome to the UniClubs**

Demo Site: https://uniclubs.co/

**How to run the Project**

Running on cloud is so complex. You need to set up database(Google Cloud SQL) and bucket(Google Cloud Storage). For the sake of end users we will run project on local environment. In order to do this..

1. Go to "backend/UniClubs" directory in terminal. 

2. Install dependicies of the project

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the project on localhost

`python manage_local.py runserver`

and thats it, you can go http://localhost:8000/ and check the site.
